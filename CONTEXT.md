# Context

Glossary for the dev S3 bucket service (`stow`).

## Terms

### Dev Bucket Service

A local, S3-compatible HTTP endpoint intended for development and automated tests. It is not production object storage.

### Embedded Runtime

A direct in-process object runtime with a small lifecycle interface (`open`, object/bucket operations, quotas, `reset`, and `close`). The first profile is memory-only. The S3 HTTP service is an optional compatibility adapter, not the runtime's primary interface. The `js/wasm` bridge exposes the same runtime through a JSON/base64 host protocol.

### Run-Through Adapter

A routing layer that accepts S3 requests at a local endpoint and, when explicitly configured, reads from or propagates supported mutations to a live upstream provider using the developer's existing environment credentials. Reachability and mutation are two separate decisions: the adapter is only constructed in run-through mode, and within it, run-through configuration plus a `mirrorWrites` policy is still not permission to mutate upstream.

### Upstream Configuration

The endpoint and credentials used by the run-through adapter to reach a live S3-compatible provider, including an optional session token for short-lived credentials. Resolved from environment variables with precedence: `STOW_*` > `S3_*` > `AWS_*`. Credentials determine how an explicitly requested upstream is authenticated; they never determine whether an upstream is used.

### Upstream Addressing

How a request names its bucket on the upstream: in the path, or in the host. `STOW_UPSTREAM_ADDRESSING` selects it, path-style is the default because every S3-compatible endpoint accepts it, and an unrecognized value is refused at startup rather than defaulted. Addressing is not a request to use an upstream — it configures how a requested one is reached, so setting it alone never selects one. The same distinction separates it from the client's own `forcePathStyle`, which is a separate setting on a separate surface.

### Mode Selection

The operational mode, and local-only is what stow runs unless something asks for run-through by name. Ambient AWS or S3 credentials are not an ask: a developer's shell and a CI runner both export them for unrelated tools, and inferring an upstream from their presence made whether stow contacted a live provider a property of the machine rather than of anything the user requested. Run-through is selected by `--mode run-through` or `STOW_MODE=run-through`; `STOW_MODE=local` forces local-only, and an unrecognized value is local rather than an error or a fallback. See [ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-local-is-the-default-mode.md); it supersedes ADR 0001.

### Read-Through Cache

Isolated local copy of upstream-derived objects populated on cache miss. On cache hit, it can be revalidated against upstream via ETag/Last-Modified before serving. Transient upstream failures may serve stale cached data; local-only writes are never evicted merely because upstream lacks the key. Separate caches may enforce byte and object-count limits with oldest-access eviction and an optional TTL.

### Mirror-Writes Policy

An explicit run-through policy that asks for read-through behavior combined with propagation of supported local mutations to upstream. It is a routing choice, not a consent: propagation additionally requires live-write consent, so a run-through configuration carrying this policy still keeps every write local unless the consent is given. It emits a startup warning and records failed propagation in a durable per-key outbox. See ADR 0005.

### Live-Write Consent

The one mechanism that authorizes stow to mutate a live upstream, given separately from any policy — `STOW_ALLOW_LIVE_WRITES=true` or `--allow-live-writes`. It is the whole of the permission: run-through mode and the `mirrorWrites` policy together are not enough, and an explicit `false` is a refusal the policy cannot override. See ADR 0005.

### Write Outbox

A durable, per-key ordered record of upstream propagation intents. A prepared write-ahead entry is reconciled against the immutable committed local object version before propagation; file-backed workers coordinate attempts with expiring per-entry claims and a filesystem lock. An already-attempted entry is reconciled against upstream before it is re-propagated, so a crash between upstream success and acknowledgement is normally acknowledged instead of duplicated. Transient failures are retried, and prepared/active entries support loopback-only inspection and retry/discard actions. Outbox files carry a schema version: newer files are rejected, unversioned files migrate, and all writers sharing a file must run the same revision.

### Persisted Backend

Filesystem-backed storage using atomic object records and a versioned data format. It is the default backend. The former `.stowmeta` sidecar format is not migrated by 0.2.0.

### In-Memory Backend

Ephemeral storage backend with no filesystem persistence. It is explicitly selectable through the backend option and must satisfy the same behavioral storage contract as the filesystem backend. Because it holds every object in process memory, the session's byte budget is the only thing bounding it, so an upload in flight and the object a completion assembles from it are both counted against that budget.

### Multipart Initiation Properties

The object properties — content type, user metadata and checksum configuration — that a multipart upload fixes when it is created. They belong to the upload rather than to any part, because no part may change them: the object completion publishes carries exactly these, and they survive the process that initiated the upload.

### Local Dev Credentials

Ephemeral access key and secret key generated by stow on startup. Used for SigV4 authentication against the local endpoint. Distinct from upstream credentials.

### Workspace

The default agent-facing surface: one call returns a real directory, a bucket, and an identity that outlives the process that created it. A workspace is already the caller's working directory, so files an agent writes with its own tools and objects written through S3 are the same bytes. Whether a workspace also exposes a loopback S3 endpoint is a separate, opt-in decision. See ADR 0007.

### Workspace Manifest

The single `stow-workspace.json` at a workspace root mapping key to content type, ETag, checksums, last-modified, and relative path. One manifest per workspace, never per-object sidecar files. A missing entry is legal and is the normal case for a file stow did not write. See ADR 0008.

### S3 Facade

An opt-in loopback S3 endpoint bound to the *same* runtime instance as a workspace, so that the object store has one implementation and two surfaces. A facade with its own storage is rejected: that would be two stores and a synchronization problem.

### Session ID

The durable identity of a workspace, minted at creation and naming its directory, bucket, quotas, timestamps, and liveness. Resuming is opening by this ID, never reconstructing state from an environment mapping. See ADR 0009.

### Collection

Bounded reclamation of a workspace whose owning session is dead, on a TTL measured in hours. Collection never runs against a workspace a live session holds, and never against a directory that is currently a process's working directory. That is a correctness property, not a policy.

### Promote

An explicit, named-destination move of a workspace to a real bucket. Never a side effect of expiry, of close, or of a successful run. It is a live write and carries the same consent requirement as any other.

### Handoff Reference

A value that names a workspace — its session ID and the capability to open it — rather than a credential. Distinct from the in-process-tree environment mapping, which does carry the generated secret key.
