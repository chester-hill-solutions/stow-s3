# NPM_INSTALL installs everything, then removes exactly the thing that breaks
# the tests: the four bundled carrier binaries.
#
# The obvious fix is --omit=optional everywhere, and it is wrong. The hazard was
# never optional dependencies in general - it is specifically that
# @chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3-{linux,darwin}-{x64,arm64} each carry a
# `stow-s3` binary, and resolveStowBinary checks findBundledBinary() BEFORE the
# monorepo build and STOW_BIN. Meanwhile jscpd resolves its own scanner through
# an optional platform dependency, so omitting optional also breaks check:dry
# with a scanner that cannot run.
#
# So: install in full, then delete the four carrier directories. That is
# surgical, it leaves the lockfile alone, and it states the actual problem.
#
# This was reached three ways in one session - a plain `npm ci`, CI's own
# `npm ci`, and `make check-generated` - and each time the symptom was a suite
# reporting on the PUBLISHED 0.2.0 binary while the developer believed they were
# testing the branch. Three of the four failures looked like real regressions and
# were not. A gate that cannot see the change under test is worse than no gate,
# because it is green.
