# Stow v1 S3 Compatibility Contract

This document is the authoritative contract for `@chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3` v1. Implementers and test authors MUST treat it as the acceptance spec. Behavior not listed here as supported is unsupported unless explicitly noted as provider-tolerant (SDKs may send headers stow ignores).

**Scope:** Docker-free local S3-compatible dev bucket service (PGLite-inspired). Greenfield Go core + TypeScript npm wrapper.

**Non-goals (v1):** Versioning, Object Lock, ACLs, bucket policies, IAM, KMS/SSE, lifecycle rules, replication, notifications, S3 Select, batch operations.

## 0. 0.2.0 SDK compatibility amendments

This section is normative for the 0.2.0 remediation release and is linked by `docs/adr/0002-sdk-compatibility-and-mirror-writes.md`. It amends the original v1 contract where the two differ.

### 0.1 Compatibility profile

The supported external profile is the version-pinned AWS SDK v3 (Node) and AWS SDK for Go v2. Stow accepts the safe union of behavior observable through those SDKs. It does not require undocumented Amazon-service strictness. Benign unknown headers are ignored; semantic markers for unsupported operations fail before they can fall through to a supported operation.

Raw HTTP tests cover authentication, routing, safety, malformed input, and protocol edges. Every shared conformance scenario must run through both SDK runners and both storage backends.

### 0.2 Naming and path decoding

Bucket names use 3–63 characters from `[a-z0-9._-]`. This local extension permits leading/trailing hyphens and underscores but never path separators, control characters, or traversal syntax. S3 reserved-name and IP-address rules remain rejected. Object keys are opaque strings; `.` and `..` are valid content and are encoded reversibly by persistent storage. HTTP paths are decoded exactly once.

### 0.3 Authentication compatibility

Header authentication may use the SDK-compatible `Date` header when `X-Amz-Date` is absent, provided the selected date header is in `SignedHeaders` and the signature validates. Presigned URLs still require `X-Amz-Date`. Presigned methods are GET, PUT, and HEAD; `X-Amz-Expires` must be in `1..604800`.

Every supplied `x-amz-*` header must appear in `SignedHeaders`, including copy
source, source conditions, user metadata and checksum headers. Adding an unsigned
copy-source header to a presigned PUT cannot change the authenticated operation.

Authentication material is read as the client wrote it, not repaired into a form the verifier prefers. A `SignedHeaders` list that is not in canonical form, an `Authorization` header carrying a repeated or unrecognized component, and an authentication query parameter that appears twice or under another spelling are each refused (`403`) rather than normalized. The accepted grammar and the reasons are in §4.1 and §4.2; this is a narrowing of what is accepted, deliberately, and it is inside the contract's own "Safety invariants" clause rather than undocumented Amazon strictness — the canonical forms in question are the SigV4 specification, not an Amazon service behaviour, and the refusals make the verifier's input match the signature's input.

The shared corpus must cover missing/malformed auth, both date forms, wrong secret, skew, expired presigns, 604800, 604801, unsupported methods, and anonymous requests.

### 0.4 Policies and propagation

The public policies are `readThroughCache` and `mirrorWrites`; `local` is a mode, not a policy. `readThroughCache` writes locally unless the separate live-write flag is enabled. `mirrorWrites` explicitly enables propagation and emits a loud startup warning. The legacy `proxy` policy is rejected with a migration error.

Local mutations commit before upstream propagation. A durable per-key outbox stores an immutable versioned reference, retries transient failures with bounded backoff, coordinates file-backed workers with expiring claims, and retains deterministic failures for inspection. An entry that was already attempted is reconciled against upstream before it is re-propagated: a put whose upstream ETag, content type, user metadata and requested checksum match the immutable local version, or a delete whose object is already absent, is acknowledged without a second upstream mutation. A crash remains at-least-once only when upstream cannot be read during recovery or the object was replaced by another writer. Durable outbox files carry a schema version; a file written by a newer revision is rejected at open, and unversioned files migrate. Admin retry/discard actions are loopback-only.

### 0.5 Conditional operations and checksums

The SDK profile includes atomic `If-None-Match: *` and `If-Match` conditional PUTs, conditional GET/HEAD validators, Content-MD5, CRC32, CRC32C, CRC64NVME, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Header names, encodings, response headers, multipart behavior, and error codes are normative in the shared corpus; unknown checksum algorithms fail clearly.

COPY supports source conditions. Destination `If-Match` and `If-None-Match`
conditions return `501 NotImplemented` before mutation; atomic destination
comparison is not exposed by the current copy-store interface. GET/HEAD apply
ETag conditions before their corresponding date conditions, and 304 responses
retain the configured CORS headers without an object body or checksum.

CRC64NVME is supported for single-object PUT and full-object GET/HEAD, including
upstream read/write conversion. The checksum is the base64 encoding of the
big-endian NVMe CRC64 value; known vectors and the installed AWS CLI default-upload
profile cover its variant. A mismatching value fails with `400 BadDigest`.
Partial (`206`) and unchanged (`304`) responses omit whole-object checksum headers.

CRC64NVME multipart initiation returns `501 NotImplemented`; completion requests
carrying CRC64NVME or an explicit checksum type are also refused. Multipart
full-object/composite checksum completion is not implemented. A part checksum may
be checked independently, but that does not establish a completed-object checksum.
Upstream composite checksums are not relabeled as full-object checksums in the
local cache. Existing multipart ETag behavior remains supported.

Conditional **writes** and conditional **reads** do not fail the same way, and conflating them is a divergence from S3 that this contract previously carried:

| Request | Condition | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `PUT` / `COPY` | `If-None-Match: *` and the key exists | `412 PreconditionFailed` |
| `PUT` / `COPY` | `If-None-Match: *` and the key does not exist | `200` (the create proceeds) |
| `PUT` | `If-Match: <etag>` and it does not match | `412 PreconditionFailed` |
| `GET` / `HEAD` | `If-None-Match` matches the current validator | `304 Not Modified` |
| `GET` / `HEAD` | `If-None-Match` does not match | `200` with the body |
| `GET` / `HEAD` | `If-Match` does not match | `412 PreconditionFailed` |

A matching `If-None-Match` on a read is a **successful answer carrying no body**, not a failed request. AWS S3 and MinIO both return `304`, and `aws-sdk-go-v2` surfaces it as a `NotModified` API error with `StatusCode: 304` rather than as a `GetObjectOutput` — so a client written against real S3 already knows to expect that shape. The corpus case `conditional-get-if-none-match-not-modified` pins the **status only**. A 304 carries no body and therefore no S3 error code, so the name each SDK invents is its own artifact rather than a wire property: `aws-sdk-go-v2` reports `NotModified`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3` reports `Unknown`. Pinning either would make the shared corpus unsatisfiable by the other runtime, and it is shared precisely so that every runtime is held to the same observable behaviour.

### 0.6 Backends and versioning

Filesystem is the default. Memory is an explicitly selected ephemeral backend with the same behavioral contract. The old sidecar format is not migrated; startup warns and continues with the new atomic format. The package is 0.2.0 while the package remains pre-1.0; the existing major-version rule is amended as recorded in ADR 0002. The npm version, binary version, and status version use one source.

---

## 1. Supported Operations

All S3 operations use **AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)** unless served via a **presigned URL** (query-string auth). Requests without valid auth receive `403 Forbidden` with an S3-shaped XML error body (see §5).

### 1.1 Bucket Operations

| Operation | HTTP | Path pattern | Required request headers | Success response |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **ListBuckets** | `GET` | `/` | `Authorization` (SigV4) | `200 OK`, XML `ListAllMyBucketsResult`: `Owner`, zero or more `Buckets` (`Name`, `CreationDate` ISO8601) |
| **CreateBucket** | `PUT` | `/{bucket}` | `Authorization` | `200 OK` (empty body) for us-east-1-style; bucket created idempotently if it already exists |
| **HeadBucket** | `HEAD` | `/{bucket}` | `Authorization` | `200 OK` (empty body) if bucket exists; `404 Not Found` if missing |
| **DeleteBucket** | `DELETE` | `/{bucket}` | `Authorization` | `204 No Content` if empty bucket deleted; `404` if missing; `409 Conflict` if bucket contains objects |

**Notes:**
- Bucket names MUST satisfy the amended local grammar in §0.2. Invalid names: `400 InvalidBucketName`.
- `CreateBucket` MUST NOT require `LocationConstraint` for v1 (single implicit region).
- `x-amz-acl`, `x-amz-grant-*`, and policy headers are ignored on supported bucket ops (no ACL enforcement).

### 1.2 Object Operations

| Operation | HTTP | Path pattern | Required request headers | Success response |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **PutObject** | `PUT` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | `Authorization`, `Content-Length` | `200 OK`, XML body with `ETag` (quoted MD5 of object bytes for single-part PUT) |
| **GetObject** | `GET` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | `Authorization` | `200 OK`, object bytes; `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`; user `x-amz-meta-*` echoed |
| **HeadObject** | `HEAD` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | `Authorization` | `200 OK` (empty body) with same metadata headers as GetObject; `404` if missing |
| **DeleteObject** | `DELETE` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | `Authorization` | `204 No Content` (even if key did not exist — S3 idempotent delete) |
| **DeleteObjects** | `POST` | `/{bucket}?delete` | `Authorization`, `Content-Type: application/xml`, `Content-Length` | `200 OK`, XML `DeleteResult` with per-key `Deleted` and/or `Error` entries. A key that was not there is **confirmed as deleted** and appears in `Deleted` — S3 deletes idempotently and reports a missing key as deleted. Only a key whose delete actually failed appears in `Error` |
| **CopyObject** | `PUT` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | `Authorization`, `x-amz-copy-source: /{srcBucket}/{srcKey}` (URL-encoded key segments) | `200 OK`, XML `CopyObjectResult` with `ETag`, `LastModified` |

**Object metadata (v1):**
- **Content-Type:** Stored and returned on GET/HEAD. Default `application/octet-stream` if omitted on PUT.
- **Content-Length:** Required on PUT; enforced. Mismatch between declared length and body: `400 Bad Request`.
- **ETag:** Strong validator; quoted hex MD5 for single-part objects; multipart ETag format per S3 (`{md5}-{partCount}`).
- **x-amz-meta-*:** Arbitrary user metadata keys (case-insensitive key normalization per S3). Returned on GET/HEAD. Max 2 KB total user metadata per object (enforce `400` if exceeded).
- **Metadata adapters:** HTTP metadata is emitted with lowercase `x-amz-meta-`
  names; SDK maps expose lowercase bare user keys such as `project`. Existing
  persisted/embedded maps using full prefixed header names remain readable through
  the compatibility normalizer. Upstream writes convert these names to SDK keys,
  avoiding accidental double prefixes. Conflicting case/prefix aliases are refused;
  the adapter never chooses a value based on map iteration order. Invalid names and
  CR/LF values are refused. PUT/HEAD/GET, COPY/REPLACE, multipart completion, reopen,
  and upstream-cache-offline paths have real SDK regression coverage.
- **Range requests:** `GET` with `Range: bytes={start}-{end}` returns `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range` header. An end past the last byte is **clamped to the last byte**, not refused — `416` is for a range that cannot be satisfied at all, which means a start at or past the size, an end before its start, or an unparseable spec. Refusals answer `416 Range Not Satisfiable` with `Content-Range: bytes */{size}`. The distinction matters in both directions: refusing a clamped end breaks resumable clients, and clamping a start turns a `416` into a silently short `206`.

**CopyObject constraints (v1):**
- Same-bucket and cross-bucket copy supported locally.
- `x-amz-metadata-directive` supported: `COPY` (default) or `REPLACE`.
- `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`, `if-none-match`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since` supported; failed precondition → `412 Precondition Failed`.
- SSE/KMS copy headers ignored (no encryption at rest in v1).

### 1.3 Listing — ListObjectsV2

| Operation | HTTP | Path pattern | Query params | Required headers | Success response |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **ListObjectsV2** | `GET` | `/{bucket}` | `list-type=2`, optional `prefix`, `delimiter`, `max-keys`, `continuation-token`, `start-after`, `encoding-type=url` | `Authorization` | `200 OK`, XML `ListBucketResult` |

**Required response fields:** `Name`, `Prefix`, `KeyCount`, `MaxKeys`, `IsTruncated`, `Contents[]` (when non-empty: `Key`, `LastModified`, `ETag`, `Size`, `StorageClass` = `STANDARD`), optional `CommonPrefixes[]` (`Prefix`), `ContinuationToken` (echo if sent), `NextContinuationToken` (if truncated), `Delimiter`, `EncodingType`.

**Pagination contract:**
- Default `max-keys` = 1000; server MAY use a lower internal page size but MUST honor `IsTruncated` + `NextContinuationToken` semantics.
- `continuation-token` is opaque; clients MUST round-trip the token verbatim.
- Listing is **lexicographic UTF-8 byte order** by key.

**Prefix / delimiter:**
- `prefix` filters keys by prefix.
- `delimiter` (typically `/`) groups keys; keys containing delimiter after prefix appear under `CommonPrefixes`, not `Contents`.

**URL encoding (`encoding-type=url`):**
- When `encoding-type=url`, keys and prefixes in XML MUST be URL-encoded; clients decode per AWS SDK behavior.

### 1.4 Multipart Upload Lifecycle

| Operation | HTTP | Path / query | Required headers | Success response |
|-----------|------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **CreateMultipartUpload** | `POST` | `/{bucket}/{key}?uploads` | `Authorization` | `200 OK`, XML `InitiateMultipartUploadResult` with `UploadId` |
| **UploadPart** | `PUT` | `/{bucket}/{key}?partNumber={n}&uploadId={id}` | `Authorization`, `Content-Length` | `200 OK`, XML with `ETag` (quoted MD5 of part) |
| **CompleteMultipartUpload** | `POST` | `/{bucket}/{key}?uploadId={id}` | `Authorization`, XML part list (`PartNumber`, `ETag`) | `200 OK`, XML `CompleteMultipartUploadResult` with final `ETag`, `Location` |
| **AbortMultipartUpload** | `DELETE` | `/{bucket}/{key}?uploadId={id}` | `Authorization` | `204 No Content` |
| **ListParts** | `GET` | `/{bucket}/{key}?uploadId={id}` | `Authorization` | `200 OK`, XML `ListPartsResult` |
| **ListMultipartUploads** | `GET` | `/{bucket}?uploads` | `Authorization` | `200 OK`, XML `ListMultipartUploadsResult` |

**Multipart rules:**
- Part numbers: integers `1`–`10000`.
- Minimum part size: 5 MiB for all parts except the last (S3 rule); smaller intermediate parts → `400 EntityTooSmall`.
- `UploadPart` MAY accept `Content-MD5` for validation; mismatch → `400 Bad Request`.
- Incomplete uploads do not appear in `ListObjectsV2` until completed.
- Aborted or expired uploads MUST NOT leave ghost objects.

### 1.5 Presigned URLs

Presigned URLs bypass the `Authorization` header; auth is carried in query parameters (`X-Amz-Algorithm`, `X-Amz-Credential`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Expires`, `X-Amz-SignedHeaders`, `X-Amz-Signature`).

| Capability | Methods | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **Presigned GET** | `GET` | Must validate signature and expiry; supports `Range` |
| **Presigned PUT** | `PUT` | Must validate signature and expiry; honors `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` signed headers when present |

Expired presigned URL → `403 AccessDenied` (`Request has expired`). Invalid signature → `403 AccessDenied`.

### 1.6 CORS

Stow MUST respond to browser preflight and cross-origin requests for presigned uploads/downloads.

| Request | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `OPTIONS` on object/bucket paths | `200 OK` with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (v1 dev default), `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *`, `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, x-amz-meta-*` |
| Actual `PUT`/`GET` with `Origin` header | Include matching `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on success and error responses |

Bucket-specific CORS XML configuration APIs are **out of scope**; CORS is a fixed permissive dev policy in v1.

---

## 2. SDK Flows to Test (Conformance Suite)

Each flow below MUST pass against the local endpoint using the pinned AWS SDK v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) and AWS SDK for Go v2 runners, with `endpoint`, `forcePathStyle` / virtual-hosted toggles, and stow-issued local dev credentials. The shared corpus is the source of truth; the two runners must agree on the safe union of SDK-observable behavior.

### 2.1 PutObject — Basic Write/Read Round-Trip

```
1. CreateBucket
2. PutObject(bucket, key, body, ContentType, Metadata: { "x-amz-meta-origin": "test" })
3. Assert response.ETag is quoted string
4. HeadObject → assert Content-Length, Content-Type, ETag, x-amz-meta-origin
5. GetObject → assert body bytes and metadata
6. DeleteObject
```

**Assertions:** ETag stable across HEAD/GET; metadata round-trip; `404` on missing key.

### 2.2 Multipart Upload — Large Object

```
1. CreateBucket
2. CreateMultipartUpload → capture uploadId
3. UploadPart × N (include one part < 5 MiB only as final part)
4. ListParts → assert part numbers and ETags
5. CompleteMultipartUpload
6. GetObject → assert full byte length and composite ETag format
7. DeleteObject
```

**Negative tests:** abort mid-upload → object not listable; complete with wrong ETag → `400 InvalidPart`; intermediate part < 5 MiB → `400 EntityTooSmall`.

### 2.3 Presigned URL — Browser-Compatible Upload and Download

```
1. PutObject seed object (or use presigned PUT)
2. Generate presigned GET URL (expires 300s) → fetch with undici/fetch → assert 200 + body
3. Generate presigned PUT URL → PUT new bytes with Content-Type → assert 200
4. HeadObject → object exists
5. Expired URL → assert 403
6. OPTIONS preflight on presigned PUT URL from synthetic Origin → assert ACAO + allowed methods
```

**Test both:** Node fetch and SDK `getSignedUrl` helpers.

### 2.4 ListObjectsV2 — Prefix, Delimiter, Pagination

```
1. PutObject keys: "a/1", "a/2", "b/1", "b/2"
2. ListObjectsV2(prefix="a/") → keys a/1, a/2
3. ListObjectsV2(delimiter="/") → CommonPrefixes a/, b/ (and root-level Contents if any)
4. Seed > max-keys objects → loop with continuation-token until IsTruncated=false
5. ListObjectsV2(encoding-type="url") → keys decoded by SDK match originals
```

### 2.5 Range GET — Partial Content

```
1. PutObject 10 KiB known pattern
2. GetObject Range bytes=0-1023 → 206, Content-Range, 1024 bytes
3. GetObject Range bytes=-512 → last 512 bytes
4. GetObject Range bytes=99999- → 416
5. GetObject Range bytes=0-99999 → 206, Content-Range bytes 0-10239/10240, whole
   object. An end past the last byte is clamped, not refused: RFC 9110 requires a
   recipient to treat it as the last byte, and S3 does. Only a range that *begins*
   past the end is unsatisfiable, which is case 4. Clamping the start as well
   would answer 416 where S3 answers 206 for a resumable client that named an
   offset it had guessed, so the two directions are pinned separately.
6. GetObject Range bytes=9999-99999 → 206, Content-Range bytes 9999-10239/10240
```

### 2.6 CopyObject — Same-Bucket and Cross-Bucket

```
1. CreateBucket src, CreateBucket dst
2. PutObject(src, "original", body)
3. CopyObject(dst, "copy", CopySource=src/original) → assert ETag
4. GetObject(dst, "copy") → same bytes
5. CopyObject with MetadataDirective=REPLACE → new metadata, new values
6. CopyObject with CopySourceIfMatch=wrong → 412
```

### 2.7 DeleteObjects — Batch Delete

```
1. PutObject × 3 keys
2. DeleteObjects with 2 keys → response lists 2 Deleted
3. ListObjectsV2 → 1 key remains
4. DeleteObjects with quiet=false → per-key Deleted entries in XML
5. DeleteObjects including a key that was never there → that key is listed in
   Deleted, not in Error. S3's DeleteObjects reference states that a missing key
   is "returned as deleted", so a response that omits it is a divergence a client
   detects only by counting entries.
6. DeleteObjects where a key fails (revoked permission) → that key appears in
   Error and the others still appear in Deleted
```

### 2.8 URL Style Matrix (smoke)

Run PutObject + GetObject with:
- Path-style: `endpoint/bucket/key` (`forcePathStyle: true`)
- Virtual-hosted: `bucket.endpoint/key` (`forcePathStyle: false`, bucket in Host header)

Both MUST succeed on the same bucket/object.

---

## 3. URL Style Support

| Style | Request form | v1 support |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Path-style** | `http://{host}:{port}/{bucket}/{key}` | **Required** |
| **Virtual-hosted-style** | `http://{bucket}.{host}:{port}/{key}` | **Required** |

**Routing rules:**
- Extract bucket from first path segment (path-style) or leftmost Host label before base host (virtual-hosted).
- Keys are the remaining path after bucket, URL-decoded per RFC 3986; preserve `/` in keys.
- `ListBuckets` uses `/` only (no bucket in Host).
- TLS termination is out of scope for local dev; plain HTTP on configurable port (default documented in package README).

**Invalid bucket in Host** (virtual-hosted): `400 Bad Request` with `InvalidBucketName` or `NoSuchBucket` as appropriate.

---

## 4. Authentication Requirements

### 4.1 SigV4 Header Auth (SDK default)

| Requirement | Contract |
|-------------|----------|
| Algorithm | `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256` only |
| Signed headers | Must include `host` and `x-amz-date`; the amended SDK profile permits `date` as a signed fallback when `x-amz-date` is absent (and `x-amz-content-sha256` when present) |
| Credential scope | `{date}/{region}/s3/aws4_request` — region MUST match stow configured region (default `us-east-1`) |
| Access key | Stow-issued **local dev credentials** printed at startup / returned from `Stow.start()` |
| Secret key | Paired with local access key; NEVER upstream credentials for local endpoint auth |
| Canonical URI | The **decoded** request path, percent-encoded exactly once per path segment, with `/` separators left as separators. Encoding an already-encoded path produces `%2520` for a space and rejects the request with `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` |
| `SignedHeaders` form | Must be the canonical SigV4 form: lowercase, `;`-delimited, no empty entries, no repeats, ascending. Header *names* are matched case-insensitively, so a signed header sent as `X-Amz-Meta-Foo` against a list entry of `x-amz-meta-foo` is accepted |
| `Authorization` components | Exactly `Credential`, `SignedHeaders`, `Signature`, each at most once. A repeated component is refused, and so is an unrecognized one — the grammar is closed, and a verifier that skips a claim it cannot check is verifying a subset of the header and reporting it as the whole |
| Signature comparison | Exact. A signature is lowercase hex and is compared byte for byte; two spellings of the same hex are not interchangeable |

**Failure responses:**
- Missing / malformed auth → `403 Forbidden`, code `AccessDenied` or `SignatureDoesNotMatch`
- Wrong secret → `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`
- Request time skew > 15 minutes → `403 RequestTimeTooSkewed`

**On refusing rather than repairing.** The canonical form of `SignedHeaders` is what
the SigV4 specification defines and what the canonical request embeds verbatim, so
a list that is not in it is a client statement the verifier cannot reproduce.
Normalizing it — trimming, lower-casing, dropping empties, sorting — authenticates
against a header list the client never wrote: `host;host` names one header twice,
and an unsorted list is silently sorted into the conforming form and then verified
against that. The same reasoning covers a repeated `Authorization` component, where
last-one-wins would make the header's meaning depend on the order two claims were
written in. These refusals are inside the safe union of the pinned SDKs' behaviour,
neither of which can emit any of these forms.

### 4.2 Presigned URLs

- Same local dev credentials used to sign.
- `X-Amz-Expires` maximum: **604800** seconds (7 days).
- Supported signed operations: `GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD` (HEAD via GET presign with SDK options).
- Unsigned query params not in signature MAY be ignored unless they alter signed headers/body.
- Authentication parameters (`X-Amz-Algorithm`, `X-Amz-Credential`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Expires`, `X-Amz-SignedHeaders`, `X-Amz-Signature`) are read by **exact name**. A parameter appearing twice, or under another spelling such as `x-amz-signature`, is refused rather than resolved: the signed query and the values the verifier consumes are two readings of one string, so a query carrying two spellings could be checked against a value that was not the one signed. Ordinary duplicate query parameters are deliberately unaffected — AWS canonicalizes those by sorting, and they are not authentication material.
- **Far-edge skew.** A presigned URL is refused when its signing time is further than the configured `MaxSkew` (default 15 minutes) in the future, as well as after its expiry. The expiry is derived from the signing time, which is inside the URL and therefore the client's to choose, so without this bound a URL signed for a date next year would never expire. The bound is the verifier's own allowance rather than a constant of the presigned branch, so both kinds of request are limited by the same number. A client whose host clock is more than 15 minutes fast will see `403 RequestTimeTooSkewed`; that is the intended behaviour and matches what an ordinary signed request already did.

### 4.3 Anonymous Access

Not supported. Unsigned requests (except presigned) → `403 AccessDenied`.

### 4.4 Upstream Credentials (Run-Through Only)

Upstream `STOW_*` / `S3_*` / `AWS_*` credentials are used **only** by the run-through adapter to reach live providers. They MUST NOT authenticate requests to the local stow endpoint.

---

## 5. Unsupported Features — Expected SDK Behavior

When a client invokes an unsupported API, stow MUST return S3-compatible XML errors so SDKs surface predictable exceptions.

| Feature / API | Example trigger | HTTP | Error `Code` | SDK expectation (AWS SDK v3) |
|---------------|-----------------|------|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Versioning** | `GetObject` with `versionId`, `PUT ?versioning` | `400` | `InvalidArgument` or `NotImplemented` | Operation fails; not silent no-op |
| **Object Lock** | `PUT` with `x-amz-object-lock-*` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | Clear failure |
| **ACLs** | `PUT` with `x-amz-acl: public-read` | `400` | `NotImplemented` | ACL ignored on supported ops; dedicated ACL APIs fail |
| **GetBucketAcl / PutBucketAcl** | ACL REST paths | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **Bucket policies** | `PutBucketPolicy` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **IAM / STS** | `AssumeRole`, IAM-signing to non-stow principal | N/A | — | Out of stow scope; local creds only |
| **KMS / SSE** | `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms` | `400` | `InvalidArgument` | Encryption headers rejected on write |
| **Lifecycle** | `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **Replication** | `PutBucketReplication` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **Notifications** | `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **S3 Select** | `SELECT` object SQL | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **Batch operations** | `s3:CreateJob` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |
| **Tagging APIs** | `GetObjectTagging`, `PutObjectTagging` | `501` | `NotImplemented` | `x-amz-tagging` header on PutObject ignored |
| **Website / logging / accelerate** | Website configuration endpoints | `501` | `NotImplemented` | — |

**Error XML shape (all errors):**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error>
  <Code>{Code}</Code>
  <Message>{human-readable message}</Message>
  <Resource>/{bucket}/{key}</Resource>
  <RequestId>{uuid}</RequestId>
</Error>
```

Every response MUST include `x-amz-request-id` header matching `RequestId` in body when body is XML.

## 6. Run-Through Mode Behavior Contract

Run-through mode is enabled **only** by naming it: `--mode run-through` or `STOW_MODE=run-through`, with upstream endpoint + access key + secret key present in the environment (`STOW_*` > `S3_*` > `AWS_*`). Local-only is the default, and the presence of credentials alone does not change it — credentials decide how a requested upstream is authenticated, not whether one is used. Override: `STOW_MODE=local` forces local-only. See [ADR 0011](adr/0011-local-is-the-default-mode.md), which supersedes ADR 0001.

### 6.1 Policies

| Policy | Reads | Writes |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **local mode** (the default, always) | Local store only | Local store only |
| **readThroughCache** | Local miss → fetch upstream, cache locally, serve; hit → serve local with optional revalidation | **Local store only** unless `allowLiveWrites: true` |
| **mirrorWrites** | Same read-through behavior | Local first, then upstream with durable outbox; startup warning required |

A `mirrorWrites` policy configures routing; it does not authorize propagation. Within run-through mode, upstream writes additionally require live-write consent (`STOW_ALLOW_LIVE_WRITES=true` or `--allow-live-writes`), and without it the effective policy reports `mirrorWrites-disabled` and writes stay local. See `docs/adr/0005-live-write-requires-explicit-consent.md`.

### 6.2 Read-Through Cache Semantics

```
GET/HeadObject flow (readThroughCache):
1. If object exists locally → return local bytes/metadata
   - If upstream configured AND revalidation enabled (default): compare ETag/Last-Modified with upstream HEAD
     - If upstream newer → refresh local copy, then serve
     - If upstream 404 → evict only an entry marked as upstream-derived; never evict a local-only write
2. If local miss → HEAD/GET upstream
   - 404 → pass through 404 to client
   - 200 → persist to local backend, then serve
```

**ListObjectsV2 in run-through:**
- Returns **union** of local keys and upstream keys (deduplicated by key name).
- For duplicate keys, **local metadata wins** for `ETag`/`Size`/`LastModified` in listing (local is authoritative for dev).
- The merged result is ordered by key, then `max-keys` and `continuation-token` are applied to the merged set. Continuation tokens are opaque; a client resumes by returning a token it received and MUST NOT construct one.
- **Consistency: eventual.** The local store and the upstream provider are independent systems read at different times, and there is no transaction spanning them. The listing is therefore a union of two separately-timed reads, not a snapshot of one instant — and no implementation can make it one without abandoning the merge. Under concurrent writes a key **MAY appear in two consecutive pages, or in neither**, and a key deleted upstream mid-listing MAY still be returned. Clients MUST tolerate this. This is the guarantee S3's own `ListObjectsV2` offers, and it is not stronger here: claiming a cross-source snapshot would be a divergence from the compatibility target, not an improvement.
- **Concurrent writes are detected, not silently resolved.** A mirrored write asserts, as a precondition, the upstream ETag that stow's copy of the object was derived from. If upstream has moved since stow read the key, the write is refused and surfaces as a conflict; the outbox entry goes terminal and no retry can resolve it without a new decision. A precondition failure **MUST NOT** be treated as a transport failure and retried, because retrying it cannot succeed. The precondition comes from durable provenance recorded when an upstream object is fetched. For a key without prior read provenance, Stow observes upstream immediately before preparing the local mutation and records that validator (or confirmed absence). A change after that observation is detected. If upstream cannot be observed, the local mutation still commits, but its outbox entry is terminal and propagation is refused as unsafe. Existing v2 outbox entries without a recorded baseline are also refused rather than sent unconditionally. Put, copy, multipart completion, and delete all use the captured conditional state. Detection is a refusal, not a merge, and stow does not pick a winner — the local store stays authoritative for the caller's own read while the conflict is surfaced. The policy definitions are in the table above; [ADR 0011](adr/0011-local-is-the-default-mode.md) records the current mode-selection rule, and `docs/architecture/environment-implementation.md` R-707 records the fetch bound this permits.
- Under `readThroughCache` and `mirrorWrites`, listing is the merged local/upstream result described above; the legacy `proxy` policy is not supported.

**Object size / buffering (v1, intentional):**
- Single-part Put and multipart Complete buffer object/part bytes in memory to compute MD5 ETags. Stow is a **dev/test** bucket service — not production object storage. Large-object streaming without full buffering is out of scope for v1.

**ListBuckets / HeadBucket / CreateBucket / DeleteBucket:**
- Local bucket namespace is authoritative.
- `CreateBucket` creates locally only; does not create upstream bucket unless `allowLiveWrites` and explicit bucket-mirror option (v1: **no auto-create upstream**).
- `DeleteBucket` deletes locally; upstream bucket untouched.

**CopyObject / Multipart / DeleteObject / DeleteObjects:**
- Execute against the local store first.
- With `readThroughCache + allowLiveWrites` or `mirrorWrites`, supported mutations propagate to upstream through the durable outbox and use the same key path.

**Presigned URLs:**
- Signed against local endpoint; reads/writes hit local policy layer (not direct upstream bypass).

### 6.3 Startup Contract

On every `Stow.start()`, log to stdout (and expose via `/_stow/status`):

- Mode: `local-only` | `run-through`
- Upstream endpoint (host only; no secrets)
- Cache policy: `readThroughCache` | `mirrorWrites` | none
- Write policy: `local-only` | `allowLiveWrites` | `mirrorWrites`
- Override hints: `STOW_MODE=local` forces local; in local mode, how to ask for run-through (`--mode run-through` or `STOW_MODE=run-through`); `allowLiveWrites` flag

### 6.4 Conformance Tests (Run-Through)

Required manual/CI scenarios (against AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or custom endpoint):

1. Local miss → upstream hit → local cache populated → second read served locally (mock upstream call count).
2. Local hit + upstream ETag change → revalidation refreshes object.
3. Upstream 404 on cached key → local evicted, client receives 404.
4. Write with default policy → upstream unchanged (verify with upstream SDK).
5. Write with `allowLiveWrites: true` → visible on upstream.
6. Failed upstream propagation → local result is retained, an immutable outbox entry is recorded, and a transient retry/manual retry can propagate the exact version.
7. Merged listing over one prefix returns keys from **both** the local store and upstream, and a key present in both resolves to local `ETag`/`Size`/`LastModified`. Assert set membership within the returned page only. Do **not** assert cross-page ordering or completeness: §6.2 claims eventual consistency, and a case that pins either would fail against a correct implementation.
8. A paged merged listing fetches a bounded window per page rather than the full prefix set from each source. Assert against the upstream mock's call count and requested `max-keys`, so the O(n)-per-page behaviour cannot return. Keys are written across both sources so the assertion cannot pass by accident on a single-source listing.

## 7. Admin Routes

Non-S3 HTTP routes for observability and debugging. **No SigV4 required** (local dev only; bind localhost by default).

| Route | Method | Auth | Response |
|-------|--------|------|----------|
| `/_stow/health` | `GET` | None | `200 OK` JSON: `{ "status": "ok" }` — liveness probe |
| `/_stow/status` | `GET` | None | `200 OK` JSON: mode, listen address, region, bucket count, object count (approx), cache policy, write policy, upstream endpoint (redacted), uptime seconds, version |
| `/_stow/inspect` | `GET` | None | `200 OK` JSON: detailed snapshot — buckets with object counts, in-flight multipart uploads, cache hit/miss counters, last upstream error (if any), and outbox entries. Query `?bucket={name}` scopes to one bucket |
| `/_stow/metrics` | `GET` | None | `200 OK` Prometheus exposition: cache, upstream, multipart, retry, and outbox metrics |
| `/_stow/outbox/retry` | `POST` | Loopback only | `200 OK` after attempting all due outbox entries; reports a failure if an entry remains failed |
| `/_stow/outbox/discard?id={id}` | `POST` | Loopback only | `200 OK` after removing the selected outbox entry; `404` if the entry is unknown |

**Security:** Admin routes, including `/_stow/metrics`, MUST NOT be exposed on `0.0.0.0` in default configuration; require an explicit public-exposure flag and warning before binding publicly.

**Errors:** Unknown `/_stow/*` paths → `404` JSON `{ "error": "not found" }`.

## Appendix B — Versioning This Contract

- The 0.2.0 pre-1.0 release may contain documented breaking behavior as specified by ADR 0002; the stable `@chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3` 1.x boundary is reserved for the first non-breaking stable contract.
- New operations may be added in minor versions if marked **experimental** in changelog first.
- Conformance test suite in repo MUST reference this file by path and commit SHA in CI logs.

## Appendix C — Request and upstream transport boundaries (0.3.0)

Native `serve` and `workspace serve` accept `--max-request-bytes`. Omitting the
flag retains the 8 MiB default; an explicit value must be a positive integer.
Zero and negative overrides are rejected before serving. The native readiness
capability `maxRequestBytes`, and workspace readiness field `max_request_bytes`,
report the actual configured limit. TypeScript startup/session/workspace helpers
accept `maxRequestBytes`; Python session/workspace helpers accept
`max_request_bytes`. The Go workspace facade has `FacadeWithOptions` and
`WorkspaceFacadeOptions.MaxRequestBytes` (zero means the Go option was omitted).

The limit applies to bytes read from the HTTP request body, before SigV4 payload
verification, checksum validation and object/multipart handling. HTTP transfer
framing is removed by the HTTP server; an AWS signed-chunked encoding inside the
body counts toward this bound. It is a per-request bound, including each multipart
part, independent of stored-data quotas. Oversized bodies return the S3
`EntityTooLarge` error. The limit does not provide process-memory isolation.

Upstream endpoints must use HTTPS. HTTP is permitted by default only for literal
loopback IP addresses (including IPv6 `::1`). DNS names such as `localhost` require
an explicit opt-in even when they resolve to loopback. Operators can use
`--allow-insecure-upstream`; TypeScript startup exposes `allowInsecureUpstream`.
The internal Go upstream configuration exposes `AllowInsecureHTTP`. Opt-in permits
HTTP transport for the selected endpoint; it does not grant upstream writes.
URLs containing user information or fragments, relative URLs, and other schemes
are rejected before creating the credential-bearing upstream client.

The upstream HTTP client follows only 307/308 redirects within the original
request origin (scheme, host and port), with a ten-request redirect bound.
Cross-origin redirects, including HTTPS-to-HTTP redirects, are refused before a
request reaches the destination. This preserves signed method/body handling and
prevents a redirect from forwarding authorization or session-token headers to
another origin. Existing write consent, bucket scope and offline rules still
apply independently.

Native `serve` and `workspace serve` also bound active HTTP handlers to **16** by
default, configurable with positive `--max-concurrent-requests`. The Go server
config and workspace facade options expose `MaxConcurrentRequests` (zero selects
16). Admission precedes body buffering and authentication; excess requests fail
with S3 `SlowDown`, HTTP 503, and `Retry-After: 1`. Native readiness reports
`maxConcurrentRequests`; workspace facade readiness reports
`max_concurrent_requests`. Clients should retry with backoff. This bounds active
handlers, not accepted TCP connections or total process memory.

For workspace runtime sessions, staged multipart part bytes share `MaxBytes`
accounting with committed objects, including reconciliation on reopen. Upload
initiation also has a separate **1,024 outstanding upload session** default,
counting every upload even for the same or an existing target. Go runtime and
workspace options expose `MaxMultipartUploads` (zero selects 1,024; negative is
invalid). Successful abort/completion frees a slot; failed operations retain it.
Opening existing data above the cap returns a quota error and preserves all
uploads. Go capabilities, native readiness (`maxMultipartUploads`), and workspace
facade readiness (`max_multipart_uploads`) report the effective cap. The native
server's unlimited byte/object storage profile remains unlimited unless explicit
storage quotas are configured; its upload count still defaults to 1,024. Neither
request limit replaces storage quotas or bounds operating-system memory.

Workspace file reads and checkpoint input scans/copies pin an `os.OpenRoot`
directory, refuse symbolic-link components and root identity replacement, and
bound captured bytes to the measured file size plus one change-detection byte.
Host writers must still be quiescent for a consistent capture. This read-side
confinement is not an OS sandbox: inherited path-based workspace mutations and
metadata publication require a trusted, cooperative host filesystem.

### Local listing token bounds

Nonempty `continuation-token` values must be valid UTF-8, at most 1024 bytes,
and contain no NUL; invalid values return `400 InvalidArgument`. Current tokens
are lexical key markers, not authenticated query-bound provider tokens. Clients
should replay returned tokens. The [acceptance coverage map](compatibility-coverage-2026-09-29.md)
records shared SDK cases and focused raw protocol evidence.

Resource-policy listings paginate permitted objects and prefixes before choosing
their lexical continuation marker. Backend cursors and denied names stay internal;
truncation describes further permitted entries. A page may scan multiple backend
pages, with cancellation checked between calls. Policy-free listings retain their
backend pagination behavior.

### Committed local publication errors

A workspace PUT that successfully publishes content but cannot persist its object
index returns a committed-mutation error, not a refusal. The native SDK exposes
`ErrMutationCommitted`, returns the known object identity with that error and
accounts for the committed bytes. HTTP returns `500 InternalError`, asking the
caller to verify the outcome before retrying. The object file and metadata index
are separate publications: this response does not promise rollback or crash-safe
metadata recovery. Stop writers and preserve both files before repairing an index
obstruction. A live handle retains the intended metadata and can persist it on a
successful close after repair; reopening an invalid index fails closed. If that
handle was lost, current bytes alone cannot reconstruct all original metadata.
