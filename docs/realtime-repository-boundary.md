# Collaboration repository boundary

> **Transferred to the standalone Agent Collaboration repository on 2026-09-29.**
> The retained body below is dated handover/review history, not Stow's active backlog.
> Current scope, implementation status and evidence live in the
> [collaboration plan](https://github.com/chester-hill-solutions/gangcode/blob/main/docs/plan.md) and
> [capability record](https://github.com/chester-hill-solutions/gangcode/blob/main/docs/CAPABILITIES.md).
> Stow remains an optional public storage integration. No remote repository has been created.

**Date:** 2026-09-29. **Status:** planned separation; no new repository created.
Implements the user's direction that collaboration should have its own repository.
The RT plan remains here as a handover until that repository exists.

## Ownership

The collaboration product owns observation, current-state reduction, participant
presence, dependency impact, decisions, scheduling, harness adapters, controls,
shared editing, UI and its evaluation apparatus. It has its own build, lockfile,
tests, CI and release decisions. Stow owns portable working storage under
[ADR 0014](adr/0014-storage-product-caller-owned-execution.md).

Stow is a storage integration, not a prerequisite for attaching to an existing
workspace or testing RT-0–RT-1. Ordinary workspace directories and deterministic
fixtures suffice for the observation/awareness loop. Immutable Stow checkpoint
integration follows at RT-5, through a bounded storage-adapter contract.

## Allowed dependency boundary

- Use Stow's documented CLI or public package exports, including
  `@chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3/workspace`, for supported storage operations.
- Pin the consumed version/artifact. The current 0.3.0 candidate is unpublished;
  development may install an explicitly built/packed artifact without assuming
  registry availability. Do not depend on sibling checkout layout or `src`/`dist`
  internal paths at runtime.
- Keep harness process supervision in the collaboration product. The existing
  `examples/opencode/server.mjs` imports internal `dist/start.js` for `stopChild`;
  that import cannot cross the new package boundary. Implement/port caller-owned
  supervision with provenance and its termination tests, or use a qualified harness
  lifecycle API. Do not expose a storage-internal helper merely for migration.
- Keep the collaboration journal and operational state separate from Stow's registry.
  Provider credentials, live process handles and telemetry endpoint secrets remain
  host-local and never enter portable snapshots.

No new generic harness package, plugin publication, hosted service or language
migration is required to establish this repository boundary.

## Extraction before RT-0 implementation

1. Create the separately named repository at the selected location. Give it a minimal
   manifest, lockfile, README and independent test command; no nested Git repository
   inside the Stow checkout. Remote creation/publication is a separate action.
2. Transfer the product, engineering, evaluation and review plans as the new
   repository's authoritative RT documents. Carry the relevant ADR boundary rationale
   and dated source references; repair relative links to Stow documents/code.
3. Port only applicable caller primitives: authenticated OpenCode requests, admission
   identity, scoped process state, validated configuration, small local persistence
   and fixture verification. Preserve licenses and record exact source hashes/revision
   provenance, including uncommitted source where applicable. Do not inherit claims,
   exclusive output prompts, post-turn receipts as adaptation proof or the old native
   writer profile's restricted-tool assumptions.
4. Leave the original prototype and storage-focused OpenCode example in Stow as dated
   evidence/use cases. Cross-repository fixes to retained helpers need explicit tests;
   do not maintain two independently authoritative versions of the new RT product.
5. Start the observer on an ordinary fixture directory using the chosen OpenCode model.
   Stow integration is isolated/optional; a clean checkout must run core deterministic
   tests without a sibling Stow checkout or Go build.
6. After transfer, replace Stow's active RT detail with an external project pointer and
   retained historical review/evidence notice. Storage S0–S4 work remains authoritative
   here; collaboration progress/decisions move to the new repository.

## Acceptance

A clean collaboration checkout can install, test and observe its fixture without
Stow's source tree. Optional storage contract tests consume only the pinned public
artifact/CLI and check request identity, uncertain capture reconciliation and restore
behavior. Import checks reject private/sibling Stow paths. Both repositories have one
clear owner for their plans and release gates. No credentials or user workspace data
are copied as part of extraction.
