// Package atomicfile writes a file so that a reader sees either the old contents
// or the new ones, and so that a write which reports success survives a crash.
//
// Two functions in this repository had this shape and offered different
// guarantees. The filesystem backend synced the parent directory after rename and
// discarded both the open and the sync error, so a failed sync reported success;
// the workspace manifest renamed with no directory sync at all, which is not
// durable until the directory entry is synced. One implementation means one
// guarantee, and the guarantee includes the errors.

// Write replaces path with data, atomically and durably.
//
// The sequence is temp file, write, fsync the file, close, rename, fsync the
// parent directory. The last step is the one that is easy to leave out and the one
// that decides whether the rename itself survives a power loss: the file's data
// can be on disk while the directory entry naming it is not.
//
// Every error is returned. A caller that cannot be told the write did not happen
// cannot decide what to do about it, and the common response — retry, or carry on
// — is wrong in both directions.
//
// The parent directory is created if missing, so callers do not each have to.
