// Package authority answers one question: is a named operation permitted?
//
// It exists because authorization was happening at the wrong layer. SigV4
// authenticates a caller to the S3 interface, which means anything reaching a
// store by another route — the embedded API in pkg/stow, the WASM runtime, the
// workspace filesystem — had no authorization at all. That is not a bypass to
// be closed later; there was nothing there to bypass.
//
// The rule this package is built to make true:
//
//	Allowed(op) == Environment.Authority.Allows(op)
//
// enforced once, below every interface, so S3 and native cannot disagree about
// what a caller may do. An adapter may narrow authority by choosing a smaller
// value; it may never widen it.
