// Every operation this package defines is either enforced somewhere or declared
// ungated with a reason.
//
// Four of the twelve were in the second state and nobody knew, because the set is
// closed and the constants are exported: a caller narrowing an Authority appears to
// withhold something the code never consults. The gate metrics cannot see it, which
// is why it needed a test rather than a lint rule.
//
// The check is by source scan rather than by a hand-maintained list, so it cannot
// drift from what the code does. A hand-written "these are enforced" list would be a
// fourth copy of the same fact.

// operationByConstName maps each exported constant's Go name to the Operation it
// denotes. A check site reads check(authority.BucketCreate), so the source scan
// finds a name, while Defined reports values like "bucket.create" — the two have
// to be reconciled or every operation looks unenforced.
