// Every operation this package defines is either enforced somewhere or declared
// ungated with a reason.
//
// Four of the twelve were in the second state and nobody knew, because the set is
// closed and the constants are exported: a caller narrowing an Authority appears
// to withhold something the code never consults. The gate metrics cannot see it —
// there is no line of code to be too long or too complex — which is why it needed
// a test rather than a lint rule.
//
// The check is by source scan rather than by a hand-maintained list, so it cannot
// drift from what the code does. A hand-written "these are enforced" list would
// be a fourth copy of the same fact, which is the failure this repository has
// already hit six times.

// operationByConstName maps each exported constant's Go name to the Operation it
// denotes. A check site reads check(authority.BucketCreate), so the source scan
// finds a name, while Defined reports values like "bucket.create" — the two have
// to be reconciled or every operation looks unenforced.

// This set used to hold only "check", and the scan therefore reported UpstreamRead
// and UpstreamWrite as unenforced after the run-through adapter had started gating
// on them with Allows. That is worse than a missed detection, because the test
// demands an entry in Ungated for anything it cannot see: the scan did not just
// fail to notice the enforcement, it required the code to go on claiming in
// Ungated that a permission was described and not granted. A detector whose blind
// spot makes the documentation wrong is not a safe detector, so the fix is to widen
// it to the real chokepoint rather than to add the operations back by hand.

// operation would also match a log statement or a slice, and would let a real gap
