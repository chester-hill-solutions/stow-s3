// The layout has to be unambiguous from the name alone, because a name is all a
// path gives you before you touch the disk. Record files and shard directories
// were originally both bare hex, which made them one name space: a key whose
// encoding fell exactly on a chunk boundary wrote its record to a path that a
// longer key sharing the same hex prefix needed to descend through, so writing
// the longer key failed with ENOTDIR while the shorter key sat in the way. Real
// keys share prefixes constantly, since hex preserves order, so this was not an
// exotic shape. A prefix that cannot occur in hex separates the two name spaces,
// which makes every component's role decidable from its form.

// Hex doubles a key's length in bytes, so a key longer than 127 bytes cannot fit

// storage.ValidateKey accepts up to 1024, and the caller saw a 500 for a key it
// was entitled to send. Those keys are split across shard directories, each
// holding one chunk of the same reversible encoding, so the joined name still
// decodes to exactly the original key.
//
// Every segment but the last is a shard directory and carries shardPrefix. The
// last is the record file and does not, so a path can always be classified into
// "descend" or "this is the object" without stat-ing anything.
//
// A key that fits stays flat. That keeps every existing data directory readable,
// because only long keys were ever affected and they were never successfully
// written, so no stored object depends on the sharded layout. It also means the
// prefix is only ever seen on keys that failed to write before this change, so
// introducing it cannot orphan a stored object.
