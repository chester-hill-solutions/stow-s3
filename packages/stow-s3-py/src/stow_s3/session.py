"""A disposable S3 session backed by the native stow server.

The session owns the child process. Closing it stops the server and removes its
data directory, and the server watches the parent so that a client which is
killed rather than closed does not leave an orphan behind.

A session is deliberately narrow: it holds the endpoint and credentials and owns
the process, but performs no S3 I/O of its own. That is what lets an async
session be added later without changing anything here.
