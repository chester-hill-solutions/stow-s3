"""Build the stow-s3 wheel for a specific target platform.

The wheel force-includes the Go binary, so it is only valid for the platform it
was built against. Hatchling has no way to say that: with no compiled extension
it tags the result ``py3-none-any``, which tells pip the wheel is portable. It
is not. A ``py3-none-any`` wheel carrying a Linux binary would install happily on
an Apple Silicon Mac and then fail with an exec format error at run time, which
is a far worse failure than being unable to install at all.

The release matrix runs on each target platform and smoke-tests its wheel. This
builds the wheel and applies the explicit platform tag for its bundled binary.

The archive is rewritten rather than renamed, because the tag is recorded in two
places: the filename and the ``Tag:`` field in ``.dist-info/WHEEL``. Renaming
alone leaves the metadata claiming portability. RECORD is regenerated at the same
time, since changing WHEEL invalidates its recorded hash.

    A wheel records POSIX permissions in the entry's external attributes, and pip

    session fails to start on a permission error that names neither the binary
    nor the packaging step that dropped the bit.

    The file-type bits matter as much as the permission bits. pip only chmods a
    member when ``zip_item_is_executable`` is true, and that requires
    ``stat.S_ISREG(mode)`` as well as an execute bit. A mode of ``0o755`` has
    permission bits but no file-type bits, so S_ISREG is false and pip leaves the
    file non-executable even though the mode looks right in the archive. Both
    halves are set here.
