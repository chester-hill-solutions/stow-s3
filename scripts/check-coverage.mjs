// Go coverage ratchet.
//
// The invariant is the number of covered statements, not the percentage.
// A percentage falls whenever well-tested code is added with defensive error
// branches that only a real failure would reach, which is how adding a 20
// statement system-call wrapper with 12 covered could drop the percentage by
// 0.04 points while coverage actually improved. Covered statements express
// what regression means here: fewer statements are being exercised.
//
// The percentage is still reported, and a large percentage drop is still a
// failure, so the statement count cannot be gamed by deleting a few heavily
// covered tests while adding a large volume of trivially covered code.
//
// The recorded numbers are a floor, not a target. Concurrency tests in
// internal/runthrough interleave differently between runs, so the measurement
// moves by a statement or two; recording the floor keeps a noisy run from
// failing while still catching a real loss of covered statements.
//
// Coverage is computed from the profile rather than read from
// "go tool cover -func", whose total is rounded to one decimal. A true value on
// a rounding boundary, such as 60.15%, otherwise reports as 60.1 on one run and
// 60.2 on the next, so the same commit passes and fails.
