name: stow-s3
description: Local S3-compatible object store and isolated ready-to-work filesystem workspaces for tests, CI, development, and agents. Use when a coding agent needs declared files staged into its own working directory, a persistent task with checkpoint/handoff, or disposable local S3 for tests. Also use when asked to mock, fake, stub, or localise S3. Provides task-manifest and workspace CLI workflows, TypeScript/Python CLI wrappers, scoped S3 sessions, the Go runtime, and the stow-s3 CLI. Triggers on "start the agent with files in place", "isolated agent workspace", "handoff an agent task", "checkpoint agent changes", "needs an S3 bucket in a test", "don't want to hit real S3 in CI", "S3 mock", "localstack alternative", "put an artifact somewhere in a build".

# Stow S3

An S3-compatible object store and filesystem workspace that runs on the local
machine. Real S3 over HTTP with SigV4, so existing SDK code works unchanged. A
prepared workspace is a persistent isolated copy for a coding task; a scoped
S3 session is disposable and deletes itself when it closes.

Machine-readable instructions: https://stow.chesterhillsolutions.ca/agent.md

## Decide first

For a coding task, prepare a workspace when the agent needs declared project
files in its own cwd and its work must survive a process restart. Start with a
version 1 task manifest and `stow-s3 workspace prepare --manifest task.json`;
use the returned `working_directory` as the agent process cwd. Manifests accept
local files/directories and explicit refs from local Git repositories. Git
inputs stage only the selected commit into a fresh shallow repository; dirty
files, older history, submodules, and Git LFS payloads are excluded. The
workspace CLI also supports resume, handoff, checkpoint, diff, restore, and
portable checkpoint export/import. See
[`docs/task-manifest.md`](../../docs/task-manifest.md).

Reach for a disposable scoped session only when **all** of these hold:

- the bytes do not have to survive the process
- the bucket does not have to be shared with another machine
- the data does not have to be there after the test run

If any one of them does, use a prepared workspace or real S3 as appropriate.
Scoped sessions are disposable; prepared workspaces persist until explicit
destruction or safe TTL collection. Workspace isolation is not an OS sandbox,
and direct filesystem writes are not hard-limited by Stow's object API quotas.

If the code only calls two or three S3 operations and never asserts on
behaviour you care about, a plain in-memory fake is less machinery. Stow is
worth it when the code exercises the SDK itself — signing, multipart, range
reads, error shapes.

## Install

**npm and PyPI are not published yet.** `@chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3` and `stow-s3` are not on
npm or PyPI, so those two commands fail with a 404. Do not try them first. The
Go module is published and is the shortest working path.

When the npm package is published it will be on **GitHub Packages**, not
npmjs.org, and the bare command will still fail: this organisation owns nothing
on npmjs, and a scope-specific registry in `.npmrc` beats `--registry`, so npm
resolves against the wrong host and returns a 404 that reads like a naming
problem. Add this to `.npmrc` first:

```ini
@chester-hill-solutions:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

```bash
go get github.com/chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3/pkg/stow   # Go, works now
```

For TypeScript or Python, work from a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3
cd stow-s3
make build                        # bin/stow-s3 for your platform
export STOW_BIN="$PWD/bin/stow-s3"

# TypeScript
cd packages/stow-s3 && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# Python
pip install -e "packages/stow-s3-py[boto3]"
```

A published package ships its own binary and needs no `STOW_BIN`. If the binary
is missing or unrunnable, `stow-s3 doctor` reports which of the two sides is
broken rather than failing opaquely.

## The scoped session

This is the pattern to reach for by default: one call, a private server on an
ephemeral port, a bucket already created, and cleanup on close.

TypeScript:

```ts
import { GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { withStow } from "@chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3";

const body = await withStow(async ({ s3, bucket }) => {
  await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: bucket,
    Key: "input.json",
    Body: '{"task":"summarize"}',
  }));

  const got = await s3.send(new GetObjectCommand({
    Bucket: bucket,
    Key: "input.json",
  }));
  return got.Body?.transformToString();
});
// server and data are gone here, even if the callback threw
```

Python:

```python
from stow_s3 import with_session

with with_session() as session:
    s3 = session.s3_client()
    bucket = session.new_bucket_name()   # collision-resistant; you create it
    s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket)
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key="input.json", Body=b'{"task":"summarize"}')
    body = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key="input.json")["Body"].read()
```

The two clients differ deliberately and the difference is not a bug: the
TypeScript session creates the bucket and exposes it as `session.bucket`, while
the Python session performs no S3 I/O and leaves `create_bucket` to you. That
is what keeps `boto3` an optional extra rather than a hard dependency.

## What the session actually guarantees

Server-enforced, so these are safe to rely on:

- `STOW_*`, `S3_*`, and `AWS_*` are stripped from the child environment before
  anything is set, so a stray cloud credential cannot turn a local session into
  a run-through one.
- The server exits when its parent process dies, including on SIGKILL.
- Defaults: 16 MiB and 1,000 objects per session, 8 MiB per request body. The
  server enforces them on every request; the client does not police them.
- Capabilities and limits come from the readiness message, so a client never
  reports a limit the server has not confirmed.

## Other shapes

- `Stow.start()` (TypeScript) — a server that outlives one callback, for a
  suite that shares one endpoint.
- `stow-s3 serve --port 0` — a server you start yourself. A hand-run server
  prints its endpoint and credentials on stdout; a session receives them over
  an inherited file descriptor so they never reach a log.
- Go, in-process with no HTTP listener and no credentials:

```go
import stow "github.com/chester-hill-solutions/stow-s3/pkg/stow"

rt, err := stow.Open(stow.Options{Backend: stow.BackendMemory})
```

Backends are `memory` (throwaway), `filesystem` (survives a restart), and
run-through (local in front of an upstream bucket).

## Not implemented

Versioning, ACLs, bucket policies, lifecycle rules, replication, event
notifications, object tagging, object lock, S3 Select, KMS-backed encryption.

Implemented: bucket CRUD, object put/get/head/copy/delete, prefix listing with
pagination, range reads, conditional reads and writes, MD5/CRC32/CRC32C/SHA-1/
SHA-256 checksums, multipart uploads, presigned requests, SigV4.

## Reporting problems

Include the output of `npx stow-doctor --json`, the language and version, and
the S3 operation that failed. That is enough to reproduce almost anything.
